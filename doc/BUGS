Each release is distributed with no known bugs; however, they do creep up from
time to time.  I will keep an updated list of known bugs on shntool's web page,
which can be found at:

  http://www.etree.org/shnutils/  or  http://shnutils.freeshell.org/

If you do discover any bugs (e.g. incorrect output and/or spectacular crashes),
please send a bug report to me at <shnutils@freeshell.org>.  Try to provide as
much information as you can.  It would be helpful to know the following
information:

  - operating system and version
  - version of shntool affected
  - a detailed description of how to reproduce the problem (this may require you
    to provide me with the actual files that cause it)
  - optionally, any debugging information you can provide (stack traces, raw
    program output (preferably with the -D option enabled), etc.)

I am also interested in general feedback.  This includes, but is not necessarily
limited to, the following:

  - questions
  - comments
  - suggestions
  - patches
  - new mode and/or format modules to be included in the shntool distribution

Thanks, and enjoy!

Jason
